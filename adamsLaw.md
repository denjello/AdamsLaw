# **Adam's Law** #

## Chapter 1 - Waking ##

"Hello Adam? Hello Adam? *adamdamamm*?" whispered the disembodied voice of his Mobility Assistant as he juddered awake. In the cabin of his living pod, the sound of the voice always appeared to be coming from directly in front of him, regardless of which direction he was facing, which made it so unsettling to be  wakened by a disembodied yet familiar voice. Whether left, right, up, down or even out of the artificial windows, the ghost of a voice followed his gaze. In this case, the M.A.'s  voice seemed to emanate from an invisible point between his prone body and the artificial skylight. 

His head reeling from the synthetics and drinks he took the night before, he turned away from the skylight. "Hello Adam? Hello Adam? *adamdamamm*?" repeated the voice, now coming from the closed sliding door of the pod.

"Hello Emma." he spoke, activating its AI. The M.A. replied, its voice now coming from the water-recycler below the sink in the mini-kitchen: "There are exactly 23 minutes until your scheduled arrival at work, work *workorkrkk*." The soft voice, skinned with an ad-blocking low fidelity version of Angelina Jolie, logarithmically echoed and faded out, as an acoustic signal that it was waiting for a command.

 Adam nicked his head, inhaled deeply and closed his eyes. "What time is it again?" he asked. He opened his eyes.

"It is 22.2 minutes until your arrival at {Associated Network Industries}," The serenly clamped voice came from the calendar display on the aft wallscreen, which visually echoed the information. He looked to its left, where he could see a simple line map of the city and his position as a blinking gif of a dancing banana. The marker for Associated Network Industries was a still image of Donkey Kong. He always smiled at that hack, proud of himself. He sat up in the bed by propelling himself foreward with both elbows. 

"Why did you let me sleep so long?" he said.

"You were not responsive to the alarms *alarmslarmsarmsrmsmss*,"  uttered the map.

Adam sighed, thinking that he should probably have renewed the sympathy plugin for his M.A. or at least updated its bios to get rid of that annoying echo-fade still around from the beta version.  "Are any places around here still serving breakfast?"

"There are three results: {0X3Ngoat}, {Freegan} and {Stella's Diner} *dinerinernererr*." 

Adam suddenly remembered the girl from the cocktail bar the night before.  She said something about being a waitress, there was a - something. He grabbed his corder from its docking station and flicked through a 1500fps fotostreme of the night before. At first he circle-gestured past the spot, but then he found her. Her skin-tight chimaerosuit made it almost impossible for his cheapo camera contact-lens to deal with the 60hz lightshow as the contours of her body juddered into and out of existence. It must have been sometime around his 5th Gin Tonic judging by the way the whole scene swayed back and forth like the horizon seen by a seesick traveller...  He triple tapped the display and the playback began.

"I'm Stella's sister," she says, her face tearing between emerald green and sky blue, backlit by a strobe. 

"Stella's Diner sister?" his disembodied voice spurts out, choking on his drink.

She throws her head back, laughing. When she returns his gaze, her eyes are wide open, warm and definitely interested. 
***

He froze the fotostreme with a double-tap. Her pupils were so large, it was difficult to judge if she had brown or green eyes.  She must have been on emo-synths too, her interest in him so clear he wished he would have been more sober. He set the corder back in its cradle. 

"Graphsearch, Emma. Whois the sister of Stella's Diner's owner and is she working this morning?"  He swung his legs off of the bed and his bare feet slapped into the spongey ceramic floor, which even five years after selling his flat still reminded him of its plush carpet on the creaky wooden floors. Those floors that he sanded and waxed with his own hands. The carpet that he lovingly shampooed and brushed clean after every house party. The smart material from which the entire pod was constructed repaired itself and was always clean. The M.A. responded from his left foot: "{Schedule based social graph edge search} costs {2 minutes} ad-time. Do you agree?*agreegreereeeee*?"

"Yes, Emma."  He stood up and walked over to the kitchenette. In front of the mirror he squeezed a bit of cleaning paste onto the mouthbrush. "Ad-time begins in 3...2...1..." came the M.A.'s voice from his reflection. Its adblocker muted the volume of the advertisement by playing back the inverted sound waves focussed at the spot where he was when it began. But it was glitchy. If he moved his head just a little, the inverted sound went out of phase and amplified the ad. He just had to be careful not to move in order to enjoy those two minutes of relative peace. He ground his teeth back and forth, bit down on the mouthbrush several times and pulled the device out of his mouth. While rinsing it under the running tap, he spat out the rest and ducked his head under the faucet to drink a sip of water. 

"**-emium routing firmware**," echoed the deep advertising voice from the right side of the sink. It continued as he drank: "**you can push your request to the top of the local queue, saving you seconds and minutes ev-**"  He returned to his previous stance and the ad faded into the white noise of the pod's cabin.

He gargled and expelled the milky rinse into the sink, briefly hearing "**limited time offer**" as he ducked his head. Standing back up, he looked at his face in the mirror. His ghostly white skin seemed ready for a vacation under the real sun in the salty wind of a remote beach. The advertisement ended with the standard multiphonic tone that was impossible to block acoustically. 

The M.A. spoke from the mirror: "{Alena Johnsen, 28, shortest edge three hops, public image access token available, single, studied graphic design at RISD} is scheduled for a waiting shift at {Stella's Diner} from minus 2 hours until plus 3.5 hours." 

"Route, Emma. Reroute to Stella's Diner. Reservation, Emma. Fried egg-substitute with 2 cloned beef patties." Adam smiled at the thought of the smell of Stella's patties. "And a coffee."

The interior lighting of the cabin morphed into pulsing blue hues as the M.A. calculated local and regional routing. He went back to his corder, flicked to the foto-app and requested a token for Alena's public albums.

"Your order can be processed, but you will not have time to eat it because -"

"DAMMIT!" he yelled. With a beep, flash and vibration, his corder informed him that Alena had approved his request, and that she was analyzing his graph. 

"- you slept too long. There is not enough time for you to travel to {Stella's Diner} and eat {fried egg-substitute with 2 cloned beef patties} without making you late for work *workorkrkk* " 

"Yeah, yeah, yeah..." he sighed. The clock next to the map showed 19.5 minutes, 19.4  minutes, 19.3 minutes... "Goodbye Emma," he said, turning off the AI. 

"Goodbye Adam, *adamdamamm*," said the countdown timer.

Adam reached for his cup and put it underneath the soylent dispenser. The milkshake-like protein drink filled the cup slowly. 19.1 minutes, 19.0 minutes, 18.9 minutes... He closed his eyes and slurped the chalky green drink.

## Chapter 2 - Making Waves

His workstation's screen flashed a message: 

"Pushing commit c920ee53ebd05f2a7163104297b3686ada5f7475 to local branch asdfasdf. Postcommit hook fuzzr initializing. Autofuzzing. ...  ... ... Done. Postcommit hook rebase-fuzzd. Rebase initializing. Postcommit hook SCA initializing. Running Standard Corporate Analysis on diff. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Results: 

- Innovation factor: 12.3x. 
- LOC factor: 3.9x. 
- Cycle count: 21. 
- Style: Perfect. 
- All code globally compliant. 

Would you like to make a pull-request against master?
[CANCEL] **[YES]**"

Adam smiled and reflected for a moment, as he always did when publishing his code. He made a screenshot of his new "high score". With an innovation factor of 12x he was sure to piss off every single other developer with these changes, which broke not only the API's, but also internal methods and indeed the entire structure of the code base developed over the past decade. If he had not monkey patched all of the old internal methods, he probably would have gotten an LOC bonus of 5x or more. Something for next week.

The last two months of work had been done in secret, in a separate office. It was a gambit on the part of his manager using a leaked research paper describing a piece of mil-tech - an evolutionary algorithm based on code mutation originally intended to find code vulnerabilities. Using the paper as a blueprint, Adam wrote a new fuzzer that not only found vulns, but streamlined code and was able to correct mistakes made between the screen and the chair.

The old-style API requests would continue to work, but just take double the number of cycles - making everyone else's code slower. Management was sure to love it - not only because they care about performance, but also because his fuzzer rationalizes at least 10 high-ranking devs out of their jobs. As soon as he makes the pull-request he had better high-tail it out of the office.

He looked to the only decoration his cubicle, which was a graphic of a chainsaw with a simple text beneath it: "Occam's Chainsaw", and abruptly PM'd his team leader: 

- ADAM203: "Ready to make the pull-request you asked for."
- TL_BLU: "Rlly? How many cycles did you shave off?"
- ADAM203: "At least 7 with an LOC of 3.9x." [screenshot.png]
- TL_BLU: "Holy fucking $$$$$$$hit! Is that an innovation factor of 12.3x???"
- ADAM203:  "Yeah, we did it. But hey, I'm not feeling so well. Would you sign off my extended weekend leave of absence." [leave.md]
- TL_BLU: "Friday til Wednesday?"
- ADAM203: "Yeah..."
- TL_BLU: Well, ok. Here you go. Don't forget the doctor's cert like last time." [leave_approved.md]
- ADAM203: "Yeah sorry about that. This time I'll ask him to send it directly to you."
- TL_BLU: "Do that. Have a nice weekend."

He opened his employee page and changed his profile picture to the screenshot and uploaded the signed leave notice. Before he clicked the submit button, however, he changed screens and pushed the button to make the pull request. 

**[YES]** 

Adam watched as the loading icon turned around itself, over and over. "20314 Files changed." A pop-up appeared on the screen: "This pull-request can be merged. Merge? **[YES]** **[NO]**" He tapped yes, stood up and put on his jacket. Leaning over the chair to the keyboard, he changed screens back to his employee page. He tapped **[SUBMIT]** and then the logout icon.

The screen commanded him: "Please remove your corder from its cradle." 

Adam removed his corder from its dock, hibernating his workstation and unlocking his device. The corporate app flashed on the screen. "Please document your personal SCRUM." It switched to camera mode, and he held it in front of the screen. As soon as it acquired the geometry of the screen, it snapped a picture of the dozens of physical yellow, pink and light-blue post-it notes with to-do's attached to the transparent piece of glass, updating his calender with to-do's.
